# Evaluation: running commentary

## Internal DSL

_Describe each change from your ideal syntax to the syntax you implemented, and
describe_ why _you made the change._

I was hoping that I would be able to keep the parenthesis out for the fly and search functions because Scala is designed to do that, but for some reason I was getting this really strange error when I left them out. I didn't have time figuring it out so I ended up including the parenthesis since it isn't a huge deal.

I ended up adding a run function in order to execute the code since I couldn't figure out any way for it to execute on its own at the end of the instructions. 

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did you have to change your syntax?**

3. I was surprised to find out that I didn't have to change my ideal syntax very much. The only things I changed were the two things listed above.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the provided API?**

7. It was very difficult at first and took me about 2 hours of staring at the API and example language to even get a start, but once I actually started programming, everything clicked and it was relatively easy from there. I didn't have any major bugs or anything holding me back.
