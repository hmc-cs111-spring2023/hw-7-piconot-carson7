# Design

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?

The target for my design is for automating drone flight for search and rescue operations. I am not assuming a lot of knowledge from the programmers, so I want to keep the language relatively simple. 

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?

Drones can be useful for search and rescue operations, but they will have to be able to avoid trees while searching an entire area. 

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?

It is much easier to move in a straight line in my language because you only need to type in 2 words rather than type out multiple states and have to think about their logic. Also, if you want to seatch an area in a general direction, it is much easier with my language. 

## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?

If you have a specific path mapped out that you want to follow, that is much harder to do in my language. 

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?

I would say 8, becuase you don't have to type out any states, but the logic behind it is still the same, just simpler. 

## Is there anything you would improve about your design?

It would be nice to be able to return the drone to it's starting location when it is done.
