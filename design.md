# Design

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?

The target for my design is for automating drone flight for search and rescue operations. I am not assuming a lot of knowledge from the programmers, so I want to keep the language relatively simple. 

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?

Drones can be useful for search and rescue operations, but they will have to be able to avoid trees while searching an entire area. 

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?

## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?

## Is there anything you would improve about your design?
